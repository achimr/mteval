## Install

### Installing the library from PyPI

``` sh
pip install mteval
```

### Setting up Cloud authentication and parameters in the environment

This library currently supports the cloud translation services Amazon
Translate, DeepL, Google Translate and Microsoft Translator. To
authenticate with the services and configure them, you need to set the
following enviroment variables

    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='/path/to/google/credentials/file.json'
    export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=''
    export MS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=''
    export MS_REGION=''
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=''
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=''
    export DEEPL_API_KEY=''

#### How to obtain subscription credentials

- [Amazon
  Translate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/setting-up.html)
- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/api-access/authentication/)
- [Google Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup)
- [Microsoft
  Translator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/how-to-create-translator-resource)

You can set the environment values by adding above `export` statements
to your `.bashrc` file in Linux or in Jupyter notebook by adding
environment variables to the kernel configuration file
[kernel.json](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kernels.html#kernel-specs).

This library has only been tested on Linux, not Windows or MacOS.

### On Google Colab: Loading the environment from a .env file

[Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html), which
is a hosted cloud solution for Jupyter notebooks with GPU runtimes,
doesn’t support persistent environment variables. The environment
variables can be stored in a `.env` file on Google Drive and loaded at
each start of a notebook using `mteval`.

``` python
import os
running_in_colab = 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython())
if running_in_colab:
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    homedir = "/content/drive/MyDrive"
else:
    homedir = os.getenv('HOME')
```

``` python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

if running_in_colab:
    # Colab doesn't have a mechanism to set environment variables other than python-dotenv
    env_file = homedir+'/secrets/.env'
```

Also make sure to store the Google Cloud credentials file on Google
Drive, e.g. in the `/content/drive/MyDrive/secrets/` folder.
